                    and mastering is done directly by the band members, who also oversee the overall art field, including album art,

                        <h2>Description</h2>
                        <p>
                            On the evening of Friday, August 25, the Korean indie-rock sensation wave to earth delivered 
                            a captivating and heartwarming performance to a completely sold-out crowd at the Belasco. 
                            The anticipation leading up to the event had been building since May, when the announcement of the 
                            Seoul-based band's headline North American tour generated widespread excitement. The initial tour stops 
                            quickly sold out, prompting the tour promoter, KOHAI, to respond swiftly by upgrading venues and 
                            adding more tour dates to meet the overwhelming demand.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As the day arrived, lines wrapped around Belasco's city block, filled with eager fans, both longstanding 
                            and newly discovered. Some dedicated followers shared their journey of finding the band's music while 
                            exploring platforms like YouTube and Spotify, stumbling upon their songs in chill/R&B/indie playlists. 
                            Even avid K-Pop enthusiasts became acquainted with wave to earth's music through artists like LE SSERAFIM's Yunjin, 
                            who promoted the band's music on their platforms. The band also gained visibility on TikTok, where their 
                            songs received positive reactions and were widely used as soundtracks. Regardless of how or when individuals 
                            discovered the band, a diverse crowd came together to witness wave to earth's inaugural performance in L.A.
                        <p>
                            Given that Belasco is a general admission standing venue, attendees faced the choice of securing a prime 
                            spot in front of the stage or acquiring the highly coveted official tour merchandise. Those who opted for 
                            the former found themselves firmly planted in their chosen spots, occasionally seeking relief from the security 
                            or using improvised fans to combat the rising body heat, exacerbated by the venue's lack of air conditioning. 
                            As showtime approached, every inch of the general admission floor and balcony was filled with enthusiastic 
                            attendees ready for an unforgettable night.
